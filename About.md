###  About
This shiny aplication is to demonstrate Regression modelling using mtcars dataset. More details about the dataset can be found from ?mtcars in R.

A Linear regression model is built to predict the value of mpg from wt, cyl and qsec variables. Using this model, the user can predict the mpg value, fopr various inputs values for wt, cyl and qsec.


###  Application functionality
* As the user changes the value for wt or cyl or qsec , the change in the mpg value is seen in the Prediction field in the application. 
* The regression model co-efficients for the intercept and the 3 predictor variables are shown on separate tabs

####  Note
This regression model fit using wt,cyl,qsec is just for demonstration purposes and doesnt mean this is the best fit.
